This documentation will cover how to get by in most of the computer science classes using an M1 (or later) macOS device.

The documentation ***may*** also work for Windows, Linux, and Intel macOS devices, but it is not guaranteed. Any errors or issues related to usage on Windows or Linux will not be addressed. This is subject to change.
